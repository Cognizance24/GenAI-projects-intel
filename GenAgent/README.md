# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using ResNet34

This project aims to detect diabetic retinopathy in retinal images using the ResNet34 convolutional neural network architecture. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and early detection is crucial for effective treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset, which contains a large number of high-resolution retinal images labeled with diabetic retinopathy severity levels.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used is ResNet34, which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture. ResNet34 has 34 layers and is known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Intel's extension for pandas, pytorch and scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and viewing the code)

Install the required libraries using the following command:

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Download the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset and organize it into training and testing folders. Make sure to preprocess the images as necessary (e.g., resizing, normalization).

2. **Training:** Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the ResNet34 model on the prepared dataset. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs as needed.

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to measure its performance in detecting diabetic retinopathy.
