# Skin Diseases Analysis 
### Using CNN Model trained on IDC with help of OneAPI Tensorflow Extension (ITEX) + LLAMA-2 LLM Model running on Intel Xeon Processor Instance  

<br />


## Problem Statement 

Skin diseases are pervasive health concerns affecting millions of individuals worldwide, posing significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment.
<br />
Despite advances in medical science, the accurate and timely identification of various skin conditions remains a considerable obstacle, leading to delayed interventions, misdiagnoses, and prolonged suffering for patients. 
<br />
Therefore, this Solution aims to develop robust ML & LLMsmodels capable of accurately identifying and classifying different skin diseases, as well as further providing symptoms and suggestions for encouraging further diagnosis with a medical professional.


<br />


## Breaking Down the Components

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CNN and LLM Models are hosted on top Intel VMs via a Backend Server(`FastAPI`) and linked with Client Side(`Streamlit`) using Port Forwarding (`NGROK`), accessible with `Requests`

<h4>1. Image Classification CNN Model</h3>

 -  The CNN Model acts as a first step multi-label classification via open source Skin Diseases datasets.
 -  Trained on `Intel Developer Cloud (IDC)` provided Next Gen `Intel Xeon-based Premium CPUs` with oneAPI Toolkit such as:  `ITEX`:  Intel OneAPI Extensions for Tensorflow
  

<br />

<h4>2. LLM (RAG) based Symptom Checker & Recommendation </h3>

- Further symptom checking process is passed on using a LLM Model that Processes Medical Books & Documents, Generating smart information on the suspected disease
- Using Open Source `Meta/LLAMA-2(7B) Model` running on `4th Gen Intel Xeon VM`
- Stores Contents from Books onto a VectorDB by Text Splitting + Storing the Vector Embeddings and then use a Retriever to Generate Responses from Queries

## Tech Stacks, Tools and Frameworks

 - `Streamlit` -> Interface
 - `FastAPI + Ngrok on Intel VM` -> Backend
 - `Tensorflow + ITEX on IDC` -> CNN Model (Deep Learning)
 - `Ctransformers + ChromaDB + Langchain ` -> LLM
